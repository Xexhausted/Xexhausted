### Hi there! :wave:

I'm **Xexhausted**, an enthusiast in **cybersecurity** who loves breaking things and exploring how they work. My primary language is **Python**, and I enjoy scripting with **Python** to solve challenges and automate tasks. 

Currently, I'm diving deep into **reverse engineering**, uncovering the inner workings of systems and software. Whether it's solving CTFs, analyzing binaries, or breaking down vulnerabilities, I'm always excited by the puzzle-solving side of security.
